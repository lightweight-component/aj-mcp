# MCP Client and Server Architecture

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) enables AI applications to access external tools, data sources, and
prompts. It serves as a bridge between AI models and the outside world, allowing language models to interact with application-specific resources and
functionality.

MCP provides several core capabilities:

- Tools: Functions that can be invoked by LLM applications
- Resources: Data that can be accessed by LLM applications
- Prompts: Templates for LLM interactions
- Notifications: Event-based communication between server and client

In short, MCP provides the rich and diverse context for LLM applications to interact with external resources and tools.

## Architecture

The AJ MCP SDK is structured around several core components that work together to implement the MCP specification:

The architecture follows a client-server model with flexible transport options. The client interacts with the server using JSON-RPC over either HTTP (
with Server-Sent Events) or standard I/O pipes.
